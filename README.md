# Speedqb

For Hong Kong SpeedQB website temporary use only.

Use for providing the rule books on the website so that visitors do not need to download a Word/PDF file on their device and use another application to open it.

**Note**: This project is not for commercial use and I do not own the rights of the rule books. All rights belong to SpeedQB. This project is only for temporary use and will be removed once the official website is up.
